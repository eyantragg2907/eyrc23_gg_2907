# e-Yantra Robotics Challenge 2023-2024

We, Abhinav Lodha, Arnav Rustagi, Pranjal Rastogi, and Subham Jalan, are sophomore students from Plaksha University, Punjab. We participated in e-YRC Robotics Challenge at IIT Bombay.

We built a line-following robot that followed a path determined by an overhead camera.

The competition spanned 8 months and we worked on problems like Machine Learning, path planning, controls, socket communication, etc. 

We were the top 5 team in our theme (across 450+ teams) and went to IIT Bombay as Grand Finalists.
