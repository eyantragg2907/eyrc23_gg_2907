# Task 2B

damaged.csv has links of damaged buildings
download.py is supposed to download them
damaged/ contains those images  (**DONT USE THIS FILE, ITS USELESS AND DAMAGED LIKE ITS NAME**)

main.py and new.py are 2 models that I trained

model.data-0000-of-0001 contains a model with 92% accuracy on training set (80 x 5 images) [ **NOT UPLOADED** ]

train directory contains eyantra ke images along with new ones I added (damaged buildings and humanitarian aid is left) [USE [link](https://plakshauniversity1-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/subham_jalan_plaksha_edu_in/EdxgmMIsp0xDoXXs-rZcdU4BaLG2ksBT3SRBCspJPe0vng?e=mCwBKB) to download modified dataset ]
